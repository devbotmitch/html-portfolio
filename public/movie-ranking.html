<h1>Best Movies of 2023 According to Michelle</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of 2023 so far.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>
<p>Disney couldn't have found a better actress to play Ariel than Halle Bailey. Her voice is magical and the movie was beautifully done.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>The animation, the music, the action... perfection in a movie.</p>
<h3>Blue Bettle</h3>
<p>First time I've ever experienced such Mexican representation in a mainstream movie. It was awesome.</p>
